      <p>I am a junior majoring in computer science at University of California Berkeley. I mainly focused on project management, software development, and game design. </p>
      <p>As a child and especially now, I am fascinated by the endless limits of how technology can be used for human creativity, especially video games. I can create a virtual world where I can jump out of space, a world where I can breathe like a fish underwater; there are endless possibilities for a virtual world powered by technology. Video games would fascinate and entrance me into an immersive virtual world where I only felt happiness. It is my lifelong dream to be able to do the same for others. When I was young, my father had introduced me to the technical side of the technology that powered such video games. Instead of being scared of the complex technology that powered these games, I became more interested and intrigued. I was inspired to take a computer science class where I ended up developing more of a passion for a career in programming. Being able to explore unique ways to solve problems, especially difficult ones, brought great satisfaction and excitement for me. I know if I could solve these tough programming problems/projects, I could do the same for video game development.</p>
      <p>I am really passionate about figure skating. It is an indispensable part of my life. It is nearly equivalent to breathing. While engaging in the figure skating sport, I suffered injuries that my doctor told me to stop ice skating, otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be able to walk. However, I did not lose my resolve in overcoming challenges even though all my practices were at 3AM in the morning. There is both a sensation of anticipation and anxiety every time I am on the ice. But the feeling of belongingness and contentment overcomes all other feelings. There is a sense of power which allowed me to skate faster. The focus was on me and the connection with the ice. Whenever I stand on ice, I feel relaxed, I feel that I have escaped from the real world which pushes me hard and gives me so much stress. I feel so excited when I complete a jump or learn how to do a movement perfectly. Dedication and discipline were crucial for every performance practice. Countless hours of practice and preparation all contributed to my commitment of making my skills perfect. All my hard work paid off because I got to travel to compete. I met interesting people and learned about other cultures. I won competitions with previous experiences. It is ice skating that has taught me so many life lessons that every time I fall on the ice, I need to get up and try it again. It is the same as my life, when I meet a challenge, it might knock me down, but I need to remember to not give up and beat whatever the challenge might be. </p>
