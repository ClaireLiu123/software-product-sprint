        <p>I am really passionate about figure skating. It is an indispensable part of my life. It is nearly equivalent to breathing. While engaging in the figure skating sport, I suffered injuries that my doctor told me to stop ice skating, otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be able to walk. However, I did not lose my resolve in overcoming challenges even though all my practices were at 3AM in the morning. There is both a sensation of anticipation and anxiety every time I am on the ice. But the feeling of belongingness and contentment overcomes all other feelings. There is a sense of power which allowed me to skate faster. The focus was on me and the connection with the ice. Whenever I stand on ice, I feel relaxed, I feel that I have escaped from the real world which pushes me hard and gives me so much stress. I feel so excited when I complete a jump or learn how to do a movement perfectly. Dedication and discipline were crucial for every performance practice. Countless hours of practice and preparation all contributed to my commitment of making my skills perfect. All my hard work paid off because I got to travel to compete. I met interesting people and learned about other cultures. I won competitions with previous experiences. It is ice skating that has taught me so many life lessons that every time I fall on the ice, I need to get up and try it again. It is the same as my life, when I meet a challenge, it might knock me down, but I need to remember to not give up and beat whatever the challenge might be. </p>
